Tetracube 6x6x6 Solver
======================

My attempts to build a solver for a gift 6x6x6 wooden puzzle cube that is made
from with 54 "T" tetracubes.

It doesn't work, there are far too many options for an exhaustive search, or at
least I don't have enough checks to prune branches early on.

The puzzle and a think-it-through solution are described
[here](http://garethrees.org/2010/01/09/puzzle/), and a JavaScript solver
exists [here](http://tetracube.wtf/).
